# LENDit
## Description

LENDit is a community based sharing application currently for the Seattle area made for anyone who wants to reduce the cost and clutter of owning items you may only ever use a few times. LENDit helps save money and bring communities closer together. Join the community and start borrowing by adding one item, or more, to share.
